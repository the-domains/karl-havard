"1,000 push ups" he said. "OK' I said

I thought I'd take it easy, and attempt this in batches of 25\. Seemed sensible and doable. First 100 done in 5 mins 17 seconds. Doing the maths, that takes me to just under the hour...doing the press ups, well different story. It took 10 mins 32 seconds to get to 150...and down to batches of 6! Long way to go. Set a target of 300...and let's see where that takes us.
